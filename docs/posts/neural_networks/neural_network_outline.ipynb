    "Many people think of neural networks as this mysterious black box which just predicts information. To more concretely understand what's going on, here is a more detailed explanation what happens when you put input data through a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input data is put into neural networks, and neural networks are a just a collection of nested functions. These functions are defined by parameters (consisting of weights and biases). \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of weights as the knobs that control how much attention the neural network should pay to each feature. For example, for a neural network which classifies the fruit in images of various fruits, if the weight for the color feature is high, it means that the network considers color to be more important in the prediction. Conversely, if the weight is low, the network assigns less importance to that feature. During the training phase of a neural network, these weights are adjusted based on the input data and the desired output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Biases provide the neural network with the ability to make predictions even when all the input features are zero or missing. In our fruit example, biases can be thought of as an inherent inclination of the neural network to lean towards predicting one fruit over the other, regardless of the input values. They act as an additional input to each neuron in the network and help in adjusting the output of the neuron. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters (weights and biases) are stored in tensors. Tensors are PyTorch’s version of arrays and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process of running the input data through each of the NN's functions to make its best guess about the correct output is known as a forward propagation, or forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, after a forward pass, the NN goes through backward propagation: in backprop, the NN adjusts its parameters proportionate to the error in its guess. This error (known as the \"loss\") is the mathematical difference between what the NN predicted and the correct answer (called the \"ground truth\"). The NN does this by traversing backwards from the output, back into each of the layers, collecting the derivatives of the error with respect to the parameters of the functions (parameters are like settings that control how the NN works). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the network knows how each parameter affects the error with those derivatives (called \"gradients\"), it can update the parameters in a way that reduces the error. This updating process is called \"gradient descent.\" It adjusts the parameters step by step, using the information from the gradients, to make the network better at making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating this process with many examples and adjusting the parameters based on the gradients, the network gradually improves its performance and becomes better at making accurate predictions."

    "Explanation of above code, line by line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When using PyTorch, which is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, like we are here, you need to create a sub-class within the nn.Module and implement your neural network architecture within it. The name of our sub-class, our neural network architecture, is MyNeural. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize the MyNeural class. The initialization method takes in an input, which is the dimensions of the input layer, dimensions of the hidden layers, and dimensions of the output layer of the neural network. For example, in the iris dataset, the input layer will be 4 because there are 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width (note: do not count the 'species' category as one of the attributes because that is what we are trying to predict with this dataset, so it should not be an input).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This line calls the initialization method of the parent class (nn.Module). It ensures that the necessary setup is done before defining the architecture of the custom neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This line creates the input layer of the neural network using the torch.nn.Linear class. It specifies that the input layer has \"input\" number of input features and outputs \"hidden_layers[0]\" number of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear layer performs a linear transformation on the input data (an oversimplified explanation: takes the input data, factors in weights and biases of the network, and turns the data into the values of the neuron within the network). The .Linear method creates fully connected layers, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer (see diagram at start of blog). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This line creates the hidden layers of the neural network using the torch.nn.Linear class. It creates a ModuleDict object named hlayers, which is a dictionary-like structure that holds the hidden layers. It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the range of len(hidden_layers) - 1 and creates a linear layer for each hidden layer. The keys of the dictionary are formatted as hLi, where i is the index of the hidden layer, and the corresponding value is the linear layer itself. Each linear layer specifies the number of input and output features for the corresponding hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. This line creates the output layer of the neural network using the torch.nn.Linear class. It specifies that the output layer has hidden_layers[-1] number of input features (the output size of the last hidden layer) and output number of output features (neurons).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Sigmoid is an activation function (here we are defining the output function), which will introduce non-linearity and allow the network to capture complex relationships and make more sophisticated predictions. This line creates an instance of the nn.Sigmoid class and assigns it to the variable self.sig.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Declares the forward method of the class, which takes x as the input data. The forward methos is used for a \"forward pass,\" which is the process of inputting data into the neural network, propagating it forwards, through the hidden layers, and producing an output inference/prediction from the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. This line applies the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to the input data x after passing it through the self.inputLayer linear layer. The F.relu function is a shorthand for applying the ReLU activation function element-wise. In specific, reLu is an activation function which takes any number you put into it (from the hidden layers), and if any of those numbers is negative, it turns them into positive, and if they are positive, it retains it. The reason for this is to promote efficiency and reduce the computational load of the network by focusing on relevant features and reducing redundant computations\n",
    "\n",
    "10. This line starts a loop over the hidden layers of the neural network. It iterates through the self.hlayers dictionary, which holds the hidden layers of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Inside the loop, this line applies the ReLU activation function to the intermediate results obtained by passing the data x through each hidden layer (layer). The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity to the network. The ReLu function needs to be applied after EVERY hidden layer in order to ensure complex patterns are understood by the model, which is why we are iterating through each hidden layer using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. After the loop, this line applies the output layer (self.outputLayer) to the intermediate results (x). The output layer typically performs a linear transformation on the data without applying an activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. This line applies the sigmoid activation function (self.s) to the output of the neural network (x). The sigmoid function squeezes the output values between 0 and 1, often used for binary classification or probability estimation. There are many types of activation functions, but Sigmoid is used for predicting probabilities in datasets with attributes that are categorical, like the iris dataset (e.g. sepal width, petal length, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "14. This line returns the final output y from the forward method (produces the output after a forward pass).\n"

    "Explanation of the process of training neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a neural network, the process of splitting the data into batches is an essential step that enables efficient training. Instead of processing the entire dataset at once, the data is divided into smaller subsets called batches. Each batch contains a fixed number of samples, and the network is updated based on the gradients computed from the predictions and the corresponding targets within the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of training a neural network with batching typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading: The training dataset is loaded, either as a whole or through a data loader object, which provides access to the data in batches. The data loader takes care of shuffling, batching, and any necessary preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batch Iteration: The training data is divided into mini-batches, each containing a predefined number of samples (specified by the batch size). The network will process one mini-batch at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Pass: For each mini-batch, the input data is fed forward through the network. The network computes predictions for the samples in the mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss Computation: The predictions from the forward pass are compared to the corresponding target values (labels) for the samples in the mini-batch. This comparison generates a loss value, which quantifies the error between the predicted outputs and the true targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward Pass and Parameter Update: The loss is used to compute gradients with respect to the network parameters. The gradients indicate the direction and magnitude of the updates required to minimize the loss. The gradients are backpropagated through the network using the chain rule of derivatives. The network's parameters are then updated using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent or its variants) based on these gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration: Steps 3 to 5 are repeated for each mini-batch in the training data. This process is typically performed for multiple epochs, where an epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset.

    "- `num_epochs = 1000`: This variable indicates the number of training epochs, specifying how many times the entire dataset will be iterated (repeatedly ran through the NN) during training.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The inner loop `for i, (batchX, batchY) in enumerate(train_loader):` iterates over the batches of data from the training data loader (`train_loader`). The enumerate(train_loader) part adds an index counter (i) to each batch returned by the train_loader. This means that as you iterate over the batches in the train_loader, you also have access to the index or position of the current batch. The index counter (i) starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each batch in the train_loader. It allows you to keep track of the progress and index of the current batch within the training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `opt.zero_grad()` clears the gradients of the optimizer before calculating the new gradients after every batch. This is VERY important to include because during backpropagation, gradients are calculated and stored for each parameter of the model. If the gradients are not cleared, they would accumulate from one iteration to the next. This would result in incorrect gradient values and lead to incorrect updates of the model parameters. Many people forget it! \n",

    "- `loss.backward()` performs backpropagation, computing the gradients of the model's parameters with respect to the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `opt.step()` updates the model's parameters by taking an optimization step using the optimizer (`opt`).\n",
    "\n",

However, when it comes to evaluating the model's performance on a validation or test set, it is important to ensure that the model behaves differently compared to the training phase. This is where the evaluation mode comes into play.\n",

It helps ensure that the testing data matches the expected input shape for the neural network model.

Checking the data shape ensures that preprocessing steps have been correctly applied. "
