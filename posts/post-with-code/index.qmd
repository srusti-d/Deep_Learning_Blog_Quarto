This post will be summarizing key points about molecular biology which I have learned from the article "Large Language Models in Molecular Biology" by Serafim Batzoglou.

In an attempt to further explore LLMs to prepare for my upcoming project regarding LLMs, the following summary of the biological information in the above article was generated by prompting ChatGPT and edited by me.

### **Central Dogma**

The central dogma of molecular biology explains how genetic information flows within living organisms. It states that DNA, which is housed in the nucleus of every cell, is the source of this genetic information. Human DNA consists of approximately 3 billion nucleotides organized into 23 chromosomes, with 22 being autosomes and one being a sex chromosome (X or Y). Each person inherits two nearly identical copies of the human genome, one from each parent. The genetic material from both parents is retained in the nucleus of each of the roughly 30 trillion cells in the human body. The genome contains about 20,000 genes responsible for protein synthesis, with only about 1% of the genome coding for proteins. The remaining portions of the genome include regions that control gene expression, regions within genes that do not code for proteins, regions contributing to DNA structure, and "junk" regions of self-replicating DNA.

Protein synthesis, a fundamental process in molecular biology, involves three main steps: transcription, splicing, and translation. During transcription, a DNA segment serving as a gene template is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA molecule undergoes splicing, where certain segments, called introns, are removed, and the remaining segments, called exons, are joined together to form mature mRNA. Splicing is crucial in higher organisms because it allows a single gene to produce multiple protein variants by assembling different combinations of exons. The mRNA is then transported to the ribosome, where translation occurs. During translation, the mRNA sequence is decoded into amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. These amino acids are linked together to form a protein sequence, which folds into a functional three-dimensional structure. Proteins play essential roles in various biological processes, providing structural components, catalyzing reactions as enzymes, and facilitating communication and transportation within cells.

### [**Gene Regulation**]{style="color: white"}

Gene regulation is a complex process that controls when, where, and in what quantity genes are expressed in cells. It ensures the timely production of the right proteins in appropriate amounts. Gene regulation occurs at different levels, involving chromatin structure, chemical modifications, and the action of transcription factors. **Transcription factors** are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and influence the recruitment of RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for mRNA synthesis. They help regulate the expression of target genes to ensure they are appropriately expressed in response to signals.

Promoters and enhancers are DNA regions that contribute to gene expression control, with promoters located adjacent to gene starts and enhancers situated within introns or between genes, further downstream in the DNA. Chromatin structure, formed by DNA wrapping around histone proteins, determines which DNA regions are accessible for gene expression. Chemical modifications of histones and DNA, such as acetylation, methylation, and DNA methylation, can influence chromatin structure and gene expression. Gene regulation is specific to each type of cell - some cells have certain genes expressed while other cells have different genes expressed. This is what allows cells to have specialized functions.

The flow of genetic information is traditionally described as unidirectional: DNA to RNA to protein. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Reverse transcription allows RNA to be converted back into DNA, as seen in retroviruses like HIV. DNA can also be transcribed into different types of RNA, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), adding complexity to genetic information flow.

### [**Epigenetic Mechanisms**]{style="color: white"}

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a role in gene regulation and can be inherited. DNA methylation is a chemical modification where methyl is added to the DNA molecule, usually at specific cytosine bases. Methylation influences gene expression by affecting the binding of transcription factors and the chromatin structure. Chromatin must be unfolded for gene expression, so by making the chromatin more compact, methylation makes transcription more difficult (affects gene accessibility).

DNA variation contributes to the diversity and heritability of traits among individuals. DNA variants are introduced primarily through mutations between the genomes of parents and germline genomes passed on to offspring. Deleterious variants tend to be eliminated from the population over time through natural selection. Genetic variations common in humans are typically benign or contribute to diseases that manifest later in life. Some rare mutations can affect the splicing sites (the boundaries where genes are spliced). As a result, they can cause the production of a completely different protein sequence, thus different protein function. This is why they contribute to 10% of rare genetic diseases.

So, predicting splice sites and determining gene structure is important to diagnose genetic diseases.
