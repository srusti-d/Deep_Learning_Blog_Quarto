This is the introductory post about the blog!

This blog will ultimately track my progress in learning about Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in molecular biology throughout the course of my 8-week program in the Im Lab at the University of Chicago. As I continue to learn biological knowledge and computational skills, I will continue to update this blog with what I have learned.
